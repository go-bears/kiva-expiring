"""Create a script that queries the GraphQL API for loans. 
Filter for loans that have a status of fundRaising and a plannedExpirationDate 
in the next 24 hours. Use the loan amount property on those loans to determine 
the total dollar amount it would take to fund all of these loans and return or display that as a result. 
Show also a link to each loan and the amount it has left to fundraise.

Bonus: Write a test that mocks Kiva's API response and proves out that your 
code does the right calculation and returns the right values.
